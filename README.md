This quantitative study analyzed work-related anxiety disorder reports in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, with a focus on post-pandemic changes. 
Using trend analysis (ETS decomposition), linear regression, and unsupervised machine learning (clustering with the K-modes algorithm and association rules with the Apriori algorithm), the study explored the growth, pattern shifts in reports, and the demographic and behavioral profiles of affected workers from 2020 to 2023.
